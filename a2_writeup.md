# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function? Everything was difficult while completing the match function. Especially, understanding how the source and pattern works. It was quite hard to understand what the functions does but when you broke it down, it was easier to grasp.



2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database. You can make it search the movie database for a certain information like date or title. It will go through the database until it finds the information that you're looking for. It's kinda like a night guard who walks around and check every store to make sure no one is there. But, you can make the night guard search specific spots that are prone to people breaking in the mall.
